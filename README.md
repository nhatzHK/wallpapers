# Wallpapers!!!

## Descrition
You'll like some of those, some you won't.

You can add other wallpapers you like, but you can't remove those you don't
like. That's like a basic rule in society or something.

## How to

### Conribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your wallpapers 
  * With meaningful names if possible
  * Without incorrect sRGB
  * Without spaces or hyphens in the names (underscore ftw)
4. Add your sources to the README
  Don't post link to the image hosting service (like imgur) but rather the
  website where it has been shared (like reddit, or imur in some cases, or you
  name it)
3. Make a PR

### Use
1. Clone the repository
2. ??? (wal is recommended)
3. Fresh wallpapers

## Find a specific picture in the repo
1. `cd repo`
2. run ./display.sh`
3. Press N while you haven't seen the one you want
4. Note the name on the picture or in the terminal directly
5. Remember the name
6. Press Q to quit the displayer

#### Remove `libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile`

Please take care of fixing any of those before you submit a PR.

## License
Most (if not all) of them are from Reddit, so I assumed their author gave me the
permissions to use them. If you own one of those and don't want it used here,
just point it out and I'll get rid of your filthy proprietary wallpaper /s.

Otherwise assume everything here is free to use under the MIT License.
