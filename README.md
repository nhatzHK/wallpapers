# Wallpapers!!!

## Descrition
You'll like some of those, some you won't.

You can add other wallpapers you like, but you can't remove those you don't
like. That's like a basic rule in society or something.

## How to

### Conribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your wallpapers (with meaningful names if possible)
3. Make a PR

### Use

1. Clone the repository
2. ??? (wal is recommended)
3. Fresh wallpapers

## License
Most (if not all) of them are from Reddit, so I assumed their author gave me the
permissions to use them. If you own one of those and don't want it used here,
just point it out and I'll get rid of your filthy proprietary wallpaper /s.

Otherwise assume everything here is free to use under the MIT License.
