Please take care of fixing any of those before you submit a PR.

## License
Most (if not all) of them are from Reddit, so I assumed their author gave me the
permissions to use them. If you own one of those and don't want it used here,
just point it out and I'll get rid of your filthy proprietary wallpaper /s.

Otherwise assume everything here is free to use under the MIT License.
